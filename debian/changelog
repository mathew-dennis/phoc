phoc (0.25.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  * build: Untabify
  * build: Use summary.
    More in line with other projects and uses colors
  * output: Add getters for scale.
    We want to get rid of direct member access
  * server: Use g_clear_handle_id.
    Less code and easier to read.
  * server: Add getter for desktop.
    Will allow us to reduce direct member access, similar to the renderer.
    We're not updating existing code yet to keep the diff noise under
    control.
  * settings: Strip whitespace from value.
    No need to fail parsing due to this
  * output: Move enums before type definition.
    Just to match coding style, no functional change.
  * build: Build static and shared lib.
    Otherwise gir fails as it trips on the not resolved symbols from
    gmobile.
  * build: Drop gtk_doc vs embedded wlroots restriction.
    With a shared libphoc this works too (see previous commit)
  * Add gmobile as git submodule.
    We're not using the wrap as the submodule makes
    it simpler for distros to bundle it.
  * server: Parse device-tree compatibles.
    This will allow us to query display cutout information for our own
    consumption or to provide it to client.
  * server: Add debug flag to debug cutout information.
    This allows us to overlay the rendering  of notches and cutouts for
    debugging purposes.
  * ouput: Allow to render display cutout.
    This currently is used on all outputs but as it's for debugging
    only that's fine for the moment.
  * Add test data for a tiny layout.
  * build: Bump meson dependency to 0.56.0
  * build: Avoid deprecated get_pkgconfig_variable()
  * build: Avoid deprecated build_root()
  * build: Use a static dependency to link phoc.
    Otherwise it defaults to dynamic linking and we don't want to
    ship a libphoc atm.
  * ci: Switch to Debian bookworm
  * ci: Update base image.
    It's been a while
  * d/control: Use packaged gi-docgen.
    It trickled into distributions.
  * xdg-activation: Fix indentation
  * keyboard: Minor indentation cleanup.
    Make the 'Handle translated keysyms' part match the 'Handle raw
    keysyms'. It took me a second to convince myself that they match.
  * keyboard: Fix indentation.
    We want the opening brace of a function on a new line
  * keyboard: Check the power key after subscribed bindings.
    This gives clients the possibility to listen to power button presses.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/206

phoc (0.24.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  * doc: Add small getting started document.
    Add some hints how to run phoc from sources on constrained
    devices like phones.
  * server: Align enum valus at '='
    This matches what we e.g. do in view.h.
  * layer-shell-effects: Use wlr_layer_surface consistently.
    This is similar in spirit than 88b1550aff32c639b1056ee76207295cb46723f5
    and helps to identify the types in use.
  * layer-shell: Remove unused parameter
  * layer-surface: Fix names for output list.
    The list members are PhocLayerSurface and on the output it's
    called layer_surfaces.
    Fixes: afae4a3a ("output: Use a single list for all layer surfaces")
  * layer-shell: Allow to dump layer-surfaces.
    Add a debug option to figure out the current layer surfaces, their order
    and margins.
    This will become more useful with
    https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/merge_requests/352
    but as it's off by default we can have it right now.
  * layer-shell-effects: Don't assert on NULL layer-surface.
    Don't abort the compositor when the client already destroyed the layer
    surface but not yet the drag surface.
    Except for phoc_draggable_layer_surface_slide the functions
    don't actually access the layer-surface but it's easier to be
    consistent in case we need to access it later on when adding new
    features.
  * layer-shell-effects: Don't access data before asserts.
    Check the data before accessing it. Also clarifies some comments
    related to data access.
  * phoc-layer-shell-effects: Fix argument name.
    We set mode, not state
    Fixes 0820da00 ("Add layer-shell-effects protocol")
  * output: Allow to remove frame callbacks by animatable
  * layer-surface: Remove all frame callbacks on finalize.
    When the object goes away we want to drop all animations. This frees
    users of the animatable interface to worry about when the surface goes
    away since the difference between the wlr-layer-surface's destroy
    signal and finalize can be tricky to track.

phoc (0.23.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  * build: Add configure file to generated sources.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/310
  * Rename config.h to phoc-config.h.
    This makes sure we don't accidentally include a config.h from another
    project - e.g. when include paths aren't set up correcty.
  * gitignore: Remove copy / paste artifact.
    Fixes: c960805d9f87c157b4d9b0ae0fadd6cfdad5459b
  * Switch development branch to main (Closes: #256)
  * keybindings: Remove unused property getter / setter
  * keybindings: Don't chain up to contruct twice.
    We already do so at the top of phoc_keybindings_constructed
  * ci: Collect junit reports.
    Phosh added this about 1y ago, let phoc catch up
  * render: Pass wl_shm_buffer to phoc_renderer_render_view_to_buffer.
    So far only the pointer to the data was passed. This is error prone as
    the data pointer is constrained by wl_shm access restrictions. We also
    reduce the number of parameters passed around.
  * render: Don't access interleaving shm buffers
    wl_shm_buffer_{begin,end}_access docs say
    It is safe to nest calls to these functions as long as the nested calls
    are all accessing the same buffer.
    So let's not access interleaving buffers.
    This fixes the pixman renderer. (Closes: #290)
  * tests: Run thumbnail test when using pixman renderer.
    When we're pretty certain we're using pixman we can enable the
    thumbnail tests.
  * ci: Use pixman renderer for tests.
    This allows us to run the thumbnail tests again
  * d/gbp.conf: Bump meson version automatically.
    Less manual work

  * cursor: g_assert on NULL cursor.
    Don't try to go on without a cursor (which can only happen when calloc
    fails). wlroots also only returns NULL in case of memory problems. This
    allows to remove the NULL checks elsewhere
  * tests/phosh: Use GrabStatus.
    The current accelerator tests try to encode two boolean values
    into two variables making it a bit hard to read. Use a single
    enum instead.
  * tests/phosh: Make tested keybindins more obvious.
    Currently one needs to look up what's tested in an array but each most
    of the keys are only used a single time. So drop that array and use a
    define for the single key that is used multiple times so it's clear we
    just add an accelerator.
  * tests/phosh: Set and check both test vars.
    Always set and check both keybinding results. This tests that
    we don't invoke the wrong callback accidentally.
  * phosh: Don't crash when we failed to parse the accelerator.
    Passing an invalid keybinding otherwise doesn't end well.
  * phosh: Allow to bind misc keys.
    Until we allow to bind all keys let's allow for these as well since
    this block includes e.g. PrintScreen for screenshots.

  * desktop: Refresh all views when auto-maximize changes.

phoc (0.1.8) amber-phone; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * d/control: Bump wlroots dependency.
    Bumped to 0.10.0 since this is sufficient to build and run
    although 0.10.1 is preferred.
  * build: Bump project version.
    This makes it match the version in the changelog
  * PhocServer: Move startup command from config.
    No need to tuck away the command we run in config, it's only
    configurable via the command line.
  * main: Use automtic cleanup for mainloop
  * main: Use automatic cleanup for the server
  * server: Get hold of the main loop.
    This allows the server to exit cleanly
  * server: Exit when session exits.
    This allows e.g. a systemd unit to properly restart compositor
    and shell in case of session crash. It also allows to support
    logout under display managers like GDM.
    Prerequisite for phosh#117 since we also need to updte gnome-session
    for this.
  * Remove output mapping for devices and cursors.
    For cursors we don't have a real use and for devices we're going
    to make this default properly.
  * output: Add helper to detect built-in panels.
    This is similar to what phosh does.
  * roots_seat_configure_cursor: Pass roots_output.
    This avoids going back and forth between roots_ and wlr_output;
  * seat: Map touch screens to build in displays by default.
    This is currently hard coded and can not be changed
  * seat: Map tablet devices as well
  * seat: Fix wrong struct type.
    Touch is not a pointer but 'struct roots_touch'
  * server: Fix odd indentation
  * server: Introduce debug flags.
    This keeps the number of arguments and variables under control.
  * Parse debug flags from environment.
    This makes things more consistent with other glib applications
    and allows us to use expressive comma separated lists instead
    of command line flags.
  * Use PHOC_SERVER_DEBUG_DAMAGE_TRACKING.
    This avoids passing boolean flags around
  * Use PHOC_SERVER_DEBUG_TOUCH_POINTS.
    This avoids passing boolean flags around
  * server: Introduce no-quit debug flag.
    This allow to not quit the session which is useful for e.g.
    phosh development where one wants to replace the running shell
    without the compositor caring.
  * README: Document PHOC_DEBUG
  * gitlab-ci: Enable coverage information
  * README: add coverage information.
    This makes current coverage very visible
  * README: fix cut'n'paste error
  * d/copyright: Use correct licenses.
    As per de56ea6b1e3cfa41981fd4dd349b0eef852aee23 we default to GPL-3+
    (same as phosh). That's also consistent with the COPYING file.
    We keep `src/*` separate to respect the copyright notices brought
    over from rootston and keep the protocols under their initial
    licenses.
  * server: Fix method name.
    We use it as finalize() but called it dispose().
  * Don't destroy xwayland in phoc_server.
    We create it in phoc_desktop so it should be destroyed there as well.
    This also fixes a crash on server shutdown when the desktop wasn't even
    created.
  * server: Track multiple setup.
    We currently track whether the singleton was inited which
    is broken since we have a weak ref. Rather make sure we
    don't setup the instance multiple times.
  * server: Fix error output.
    We only create the backend, it's started later on in _setup().
  * tests: Add simple test that runs a main loop
  * server: Remove wayland source on shutdown
  * server: Unset envvars on shutdown.
    It's always better to clean up but this also allows to run
    two tests using the wayland backend in the same process.
  * tests: Properly finalize the server.
    So far we used the same server instance in all the tests
    which fails when we allow to run init just once.
  * tests: Pass a phoc.ini.
    This one disables Xwayland since that causes trouble when
    restarting it multiple times and we currently don't need it.
  * server: Use self conistently.
    We call the first method argument self elsewhere so this consistently in
    all methods.
  * server: Move wl_display_destroy_clients() to dispose.
    This allows clients to shut down properly, we'll call into
    already freed objects like input.
    Note that wl_display_destroy() was never run since the wl_display was
    already NULL when and we were using g_clear_pointer().
  * server: Call wlr_backend_destroy() in dispose.
    This allows wlroots to clean up and we can call wl_display_destroy ()
    in finalize.
  * input: Guard against NULL input.
    This one pops up often when wlroots or the server cleans
    up and this makes it obvious at a glance what's wrong.
    We can't use PHOC_IS_INPUT yet since it's not a gobject yet.
  * README: document how to run the tests.
    This allows us to mention xvfb-run which is needed for screenshot
    comparison tests.
  * protocols: Generate client protocols.
    These are needed by the tests
  * protocols: Add wlr-screencopy-manager
  * tests: Add testlib.
    This allows to run a wayland client against the compositor
    and to take and compare screenshot of the output. (Closes: #40)
  * tests: Add simple client test.
    This validates that clients can connect and find their globals
    and also demos the library usage.
  * tests: Add layer shell test.
    Initial tests to test layer-shell layout (since we had several
    surprises there). This also demos the screenhost machinery.
    For tests to succeed they need to run under e.g. xfvb since
    the mouse cursor might get placed differently otherwise.
  * gitlab-ci: Don't reset xvfb between test runs.
    This should avoid connection failures with multiple tests. We
    do the same with libhandy.
  * seat: Be consistent with whitespace.
    Let's not mix tab and spaces in the same function.
  * seat: Don't notify activity on `set_cursor`
    Rather notify on tool set_cursor activity where it is important.
    This avoids setting activity events on `set_cursor` when nothing
    really changed.
    To see what thi fixes blank the screen using `lock sreen` in phosh
    with https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/phosh/-/merge_requests/300
    applied and see it wake up right away.
  * desktop: Add getter/setter for maximization
  * tests: testlib: Add server prepare hook.
    This allows to tweak the compositor configuration before
    launching the client
  * tests: Wire up xdg_wm_base.
    This will be used in followup commits for xdg-shell testing
  * tests: Add initial xdg-shell tests
  * output: Enable new outputs by default.
    This was done by wlroots but isn't in 'recent' versions (which gives
    the compositor more room). (Closes: #130)
  * phosh: Drop xdg-switcher interface.
    Instead of requiring a phosh/phoc lockstep upgrade post an error if a
    client wants to bind the protcol. This keeps the code we need carry
    minimal but we can still be backward compatible (this is not breaking
    clients that don't use that part of the protocol).
  * input: Make_device_type() public
    public. While at that rename to phoc_get_device_type ()
  * Rename virtual_keyboard.[ch] to virtual_[ch]
    We handle virtual pointer there as well.
  * virtual: Use g_return_if_fail () instead of wlr_log ()
    We can turn this into a type check later on and it makes
    sure log domains work correctly.
  * Implement virtual pointer protocol

  [ Arnaud Ferraris ]
  * d/copyright: fix upstream files list and improve readability

  [ Nícolas F. R. A. Prado ]

phoc (0.1.5) amber; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * input: Use g_* for logging.
    This makes log domains work for input as well.
  * seat: Don't initialize tablets if we don't have libinput.
    This leads to crashes otherwise e.g. on the wayland backend
  * phosh: Fix indentation
  * view: Introduce helper to find a roots_surface from a given wlr_surface.
  * protocols: Add gtk-shell v3.
    Taken from gtk 3.24.8. This will allow to implement raising surfaces on
    their request and startup notifications if we want these before there's a
    mainlineable protocol.
  * Implement gtk-shell's handle_request_focus.
    This allows to raise windows on their request.
    See https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/phoc/issues/93
  * desktop: Wire up gtk-shell

  [ Sebastian Krzyszkowiak ]
  * view: Hide shell overlay when activating a fullscreen window.
    Without that, the overlay stays needlessly visible after selecting a
    fullscreen window in the activity switcher until further input event.

    be worse than stable
  * Introduce view_is_maximized.
    This will allow us to introduce a tiled state as well.
  * view: Simple left right tilig.
    This uses the 'maximized' state to get rid of GTK's drop
    shadows until we have fixed
    https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/issues/2171
  * view: Differentiate between tiled and normal on unmaximize
  * keybindings: bind left and right tiling
  * d/control: Depend on gsettings schemas.
    Not having them makes us not start
